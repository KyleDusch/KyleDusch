👋 Hi, I’m @KyleDusch, a passionate developer with a focus on Python and C++.

👀 I’m interested in leveraging Python for data analysis, machine learning, and web development, while exploring the world of high-performance computing with C++.

🌱 Currently, I'm deepening my skills in Django and React, aiming to build dynamic web applications that merge the best of both worlds.

💞️ I’m always eager to collaborate on projects ranging from game development and mobile apps to task automation. Let's work together to create innovative solutions!

📫 Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or drop me an email at Kylejadusch@gmail.com to discuss exciting opportunities or projects.
