👋 Hi, I’m @KyleDusch, a passionate developer with a focus on Python and C++.

👀 I’m interested in leveraging Python for data analysis, real world task automation to improve efficiency and positively effect day to day lives of people using these tools, and web development, while exploring the world of high-performance computing with C++.

🌱 Currently, I'm deepening my skills in Django, React and Node.js , aiming to build dynamic web applications that merge the best of both worlds.

💞️ I’m always eager to collaborate on projects ranging from game development and mobile apps to task automation. Let's work together to create innovative solutions!

📫 Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or drop me an email at kylejadusch@gmail.com to discuss exciting opportunities or projects.
